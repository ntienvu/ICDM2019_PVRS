# Efficient Bayesian Optimization for Uncertainty Reduction over Perceived Optima Locations

This is the source code for our ICDM 2019 submission entitled "Efficient Bayesian Optimization for Uncertainty Reduction over Perceived Optima Locations"
Copy right by the authors.

# Scripts:
## Running the demo in the "demo" folder
demo_PVRS_with_plot.py # run a simple illustration
demo_PVRS.py # run a PVRS in sequential setting
demo_batch_PVRS.py # run a PVRS in a batch setting

## Running to reproduce experiments
run_all_benchmark_functions.py # benchmark functions


After running these scripts to reproduce experiments, the results will be stored as pickles files in "pickle_storage" folder.

# Dependencies
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Scikit-learn
